Waydroid Start Script
=====================

Description:
This script manages Waydroid initialization and file sharing setup between the host system and Android container.

Features:
- Starts or restarts Waydroid container service
- Initializes Waydroid with GApps support
- Handles first-time setup
- Creates and mounts shared directory for file transfer between host and Android

Requirements:
- Waydroid installed and configured
- sudo privileges for system operations
- systemd for service management

Usage:
Simply run the script. It will:
1. Check if Waydroid is running and offer to restart if needed
2. Initialize Waydroid if not already done
3. Set up file sharing between host and Android container

Directory Structure:
- Waydroid share directory: ~/.local/share/waydroid/data/media/0/Share
- Host mount point: ~/Public/Android

Note: The script uses bind mount to enable file sharing between systems.
