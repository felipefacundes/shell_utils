# Bash Script Analysis - Letter Frequency Counter

## Overview
This Bash script is a sophisticated text analysis tool designed to identify and count letter 
frequencies within a given phrase. Licensed under GPLv3 and created by Felipe Facundes, it demonstrates 
advanced Bash scripting techniques and practical string manipulation.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Robust Input Handling
- Implements comprehensive command-line argument validation
- Includes built-in help functionality (--help, -h flags)
- Gracefully handles empty inputs with appropriate user feedback

### Advanced String Processing
- Efficiently removes whitespace from input text while preserving letter sequence
- Utilizes Bash's native string manipulation capabilities for character extraction
- Implements character-by-character analysis for precise letter counting

### Data Structure Implementation
- Uses associative arrays for efficient letter frequency tracking
- Maintains a running count of each letter's occurrences
- Demonstrates advanced Bash array manipulation techniques

### Results Processing and Output
- Tracks and updates the most frequently occurring letter in real-time
- Provides detailed output showing each letter's frequency
- Concludes with a clear summary showing the most repeated letter and its count

### Technical Strengths
- Memory efficient due to minimal variable usage
- Well-documented with clear comments
- Follows good coding practices with meaningful variable names
- Modular design makes it easy to modify or extend functionality
