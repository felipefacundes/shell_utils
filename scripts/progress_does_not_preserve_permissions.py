Script Summary: Advanced Directory Copying Utility with Progress Tracking

Purpose:
A Python script designed to copy directories with a detailed progress bar, providing visual feedback during file transfer operations.

Strong Points:
1. Progress Tracking: Utilizes tqdm library to display real-time copy progress
2. Total File Size Calculation: Computes and tracks total transfer size
3. User-Friendly Interface: Simple command-line usage
4. Error Handling: Prevents overwriting existing destination directories
5. Large File Support: Reads and writes files in manageable 1MB chunks

Capabilities:
- Copies entire directory structures
- Shows transfer speed and estimated time remaining
- Handles large directories and files efficiently

Limitation:
- Does NOT preserve original file permissions during the copy process, which might be a critical consideration for system administrators 
or users requiring exact file attribute replication

Recommended Use:
Ideal for users needing a visually informative directory copy tool with clear progress indication.

Dependencies
1. tqdm - Third-party library (install via pip)
2. os - Native library (no installation required)
3. sys - Native library (no installation required)
4. shutil - Native library (no installation required)

### Installation of Dependencies
To install the required third-party dependency, run the following command:

pip install tqdm

This will install the 'tqdm' package necessary for the script to function properly. 
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
