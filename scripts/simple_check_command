: <<'DOCUMENTATION'
This Bash script checks if a given command exists in the system's binary directories. 

Strengths:
1. Validates the existence of commands in both standard and user-defined binary paths.
2. Differentiates between system commands, aliases, and functions.
3. Provides clear error messages for better user feedback.

Capabilities:
- Efficiently handles command verification.
- Supports extensibility for custom binaries.
