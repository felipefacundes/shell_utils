: <<'DOCUMENTATION'
This Bash script is designed to process PDF files in a directory, identifying and listing them or opening them using 
a specified application. Its key strengths include:

1. Flexibility: Allows users to specify an application for opening PDFs or simply list the PDF files.  
2. Accuracy: Reliably identifies PDF files by checking their MIME type.  
3. Efficiency: Automatically detects and processes PDF files in the current directory, providing a clear output.  

Capabilities: The script can identify PDF files, open them with a chosen app, or list them for further use.
