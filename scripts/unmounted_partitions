: <<'DOCUMENTATION'
This Bash script checks for block devices on the system and identifies which ones are not currently mounted.
Its strengths include providing a straightforward method to list unmounted devices, which can be useful for 
system administration tasks. The script efficiently utilizes lsblk and findmnt commands to gather and verify 
device information.

    if ! findmnt -rno SOURCE,TARGET "$device" >/dev/null; then
        echo "$device is not mounted"
    fi
