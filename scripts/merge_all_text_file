: <<'DOCUMENTATION'
A bash script designed to merge multiple text files in the current directory into a single file called 'merged_text_files.txt'. 
It checks for the existence of text files, concatenates their contents with a newline separator, and handles potential errors 
if no text files are present. The script provides a simple method for combining text file contents in a single output file.
